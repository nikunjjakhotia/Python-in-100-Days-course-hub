# 🧠 Day 02 – Exercise: Variables and Data Types

## 🧪 Exercise 1: Swap Two Variables

Write a Python program that swaps the values of two variables.  
Example:

```python
a = 5
b = 10
# After swapping:
# a should be 10, b should be 5
```

## 🧪 Exercise 2: Simple Calculator

Create variables `x` and `y`, assign any two numbers, and print their:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

Example output:

```python
x = 8
y = 2
print("Addition:", x + y)
print("Subtraction:", x - y)
# and so on...
```

## 🧪 Exercise 3: Type Identification

Create one variable of each of the following data types and print their type using `type()`:

- Integer
- Float
- String
- Boolean

Example:

```python
x = 5
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>
```

## 🧪 Bonus Exercise: Temperature Converter

Create a variable `celsius` and convert it to Fahrenheit using the formula:

```
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
```

Print the output as:

```python
Celsius: 30 → Fahrenheit: 86.0
```
