# 📘 Day 02: Comments, Variables & Data Types

---

## 🧠 What You'll Learn Today

1. ✏️ Writing comments in Python
2. 🧮 Creating and naming variables
3. 🔤 Understanding basic data types (int, float, str, bool)

---

## 🧾 1. Comments

Comments are used to explain your code and are **ignored by Python**.

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello!")  # This is an inline comment
```

Note - Triple Quotes can be used to comment an entire code block in python. 

> ✅ Use comments to make your code easy to understand.

## 💾 2. Variables

Variables store information that can be used later.

```python
name = "Nikunj"
age = 30
```

> 🧠 Python figures out the type of variable automatically (called "dynamic typing").

## 📊 3. Data Types

| Type      | Example        | Description                  |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------------|
| `int`     | `25`           | Whole number                 |
| `float`   | `3.14`         | Decimal number               |
| `str`     | `"Hello"`      | Text or string               |
| `bool`    | `True, False`  | Boolean (yes/no) values      |

```python
is_student = True
height = 5.9
```

---

## 🔄 Type Checking

Use the `type()` function to check data types.

```python
print(type("Python"))  # <class 'str'>
print(type(42))        # <class 'int'>
```

---

## 🧠 Quick Tips

- Variable names are **case-sensitive**
- Use descriptive names: `user_name`, `total_price`
- Avoid using Python keywords (like `print`, `type`, `if`) as variable names

---

## ✅ Practice it Yourself

```python
# Define your name, age, and whether you're learning Python
# Print them in 3 separate lines
```
