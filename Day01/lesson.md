✏️ Your First Python Program
Let’s write the legendary “Hello, World!” program.

Open any text editor or IDE (VS Code, Notepad++, PyCharm, etc.)

Create a new file named hello.py
Type this code:
print("Hello, World!")

Save the file, then run it from terminal:
Open CMD -> Make sure you navigate to the path where your file has been saved. 

python hello.py

🎉 You just ran your first Python program!

🧠 Concepts Covered Today
- What is Python
- Why Python is popular
- Installing Python
- Writing and running your first Python script

📚 Assignment

1. Write a program that prints your name:
print("My name is Nikunj")

2. Write 3 more print() statements of your choice. Example:
print("I love coding!")
print("Python is fun.")
print("Let’s do this 💪")

3. Bonus: Try using print() with different types:
print(5)                # integer
print(3.14)             # float
print("Learning")       # string
print(True)             # boolean

✅ What’s Next?
In Day 2, we’ll cover:
